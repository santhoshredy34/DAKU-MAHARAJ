Our project's purpose is to develop a progress tracker that indicates an individual's level of advancement toward a particular objective. Suppose you want to see how near you are to achieving your goal, such as saving cups or doing jobs. You may visually monitor your accomplishments with the aid of this progress tracker.

What's going on?
As you save cups or finish actions, a progress meter appears on the screen. The progress bar fills up as you save more cups.

The bar only shows a small amount of progress (10%) when you save no cups.
The bar fills up by 10% for each additional cup that is saved. Thus, the bar will be 50% full if 5 cups are saved.


This is beneficial since it allows you to see how far you've come. It's similar to seeing how much of a task you've finished, but more entertaining and interesting!

What Makes It Beneficial?
The following are some uses for the progress tracker:

Establishing goals allows you to quickly monitor your success, whether you're tracking your workouts, studies, or other personal accomplishments.
Motivation: You are inspired to keep going till you accomplish your objective as you watch the bar fill up.
Feedback: It gives you quick feedback on your progress and the amount of work still to be done.
How Do We Monitor It?
The progress bar will automatically update to show your new progress each time you save a cup. It increases by 10% if you save one cup. The bar will be half full at 50% if you save five cups. This is an easy method to gauge your progress toward your objective.

What Comes Next?
There are lots of exciting possibilities to grow this project. You could:

Establish various objectives and monitor your progress toward them.
Personalize the progress bar's look to suit your preferences.
Use it in applications that monitor workouts, tasks, or other activities.
